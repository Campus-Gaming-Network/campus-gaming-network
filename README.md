The project uses nodejs which can be downloaded here:

- [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Clone

---

- Clone this repo to you local machine using:

  https://github.com/bsansone/campus-gaming-network.git

## Setup

---

Once you have the project on your local machine, open up a terminal in the project folder and run,

```shell
$ npm install
```

to download and install the dependencies.

### Firebase

---

A Firebase project must be created to fully test and run the app. You can sign up using your google account here:

https://firebase.google.com/

Create a project and call it `campus-gaming-network-test` or something along those lines. You will need to initialize a new database as well as enable the `Email/Password` authentication method. You can view the Firebase documentation here:

https://firebase.google.com/docs

To register the app to your firebase account you must:

1. Copy the contents of `.env.sample` into a new file called `.env.local`

2. Populate the firebase section of that `.env.local` file with your unique Firebase SDK snippet found under your firebase project settings.

```javascript
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: 'AIzaSyDOCAbC123dEf456GhI789jKl01-MnO',
  authDomain: 'myapp-project-123.firebaseapp.com',
  databaseURL: 'https://myapp-project-123.firebaseio.com',
  projectId: 'myapp-project-123',
  storageBucket: 'myapp-project-123.appspot.com',
  messagingSenderId: '65211879809',
  appId: '1:65211879909:web:3ae38ef1cdcb2e01fe5f0c',
};
```

```
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=xxxxXXXX
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=xxxxXXXX.firebaseapp.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=https://xxxXXXX.firebaseio.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=xxxxXXXX
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=xxxxXXXX.appspot.com
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=xxxxXXXX
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=xxxxXXXX:xxxxXXXX:xxxxXXXX:xxxxXXXX
```

3. To upload the cloud functions into you firebase project run,

```shell
$ firebase deploy
```

4. To upload the schools info into the db, navigate to the `uploadSchools` folder in the app directory and run,

```shell
$ npm install
```

- this will create a `node_modules` folder and install the dependencies to upload the schools into the database.

- you should now see a `schools` collection was created and populated with several school documents in your firebase project.
